7. The application will keep running in the background, checking for available slots. The voice notification will be sent out once a slot is found

8. Once you're notified, quickly select a slot and finish checking out because available slots disappear almost instantly

## Inspiration and idea behind this tool:

The Coronavirus 2019 pandemic caused a surge in demand for grocery delivery services, making it nearly impossible to find an open delivery slot. My intention in providing this tool is to help people get the essentials at their doorsteps without having to step out of home. The idea sprang up when I saw my friends and family struggling to get groceries and essentials due to unavailability of slots.

## Notes:
1. The script will stop running if you navigate elsewhere from the checkout page. You need to re-run the tool and re-login for the code to continue finding the slots.

2. If you are logged out due to inactive session, you need to re-run the tool.


## Disclaimer:
The tool does not guarantee a definite slot. It avoids the manual work of having to check for slots countless number of times in order to get one. The tool runs in background and checks for available slots for you and alerts you when a slot is found.

Please keep trying and eventually a slot should work!
